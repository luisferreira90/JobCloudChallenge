# JobCloud Challenge

## How to run the project

1. Install dependencies via `npm install`;
2. Run the app: `ng run Test:serve`;
3. Run json-server: `json-server --watch db.json`;
4. Open the project on `http://localhost:4200/`;
5. And thanks for taking the time to evaluate my assignment!

This project comes with a pre-defined database. If you want to use it, rename the file `_db.json` to `db.json`.
If you don't, the application will have no data in the beginning (and that's perfectly fine).

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests.

## Bonus features

- Create invoice when creating the job ad (not just from the list);
- Unit tests;
- The ability to receive notifications when a job ad is created, edited, or deleted.
